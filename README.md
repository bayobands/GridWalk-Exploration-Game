# Gridwalk

A location-based crafting game where real-world movement drives gameplay. Players explore a grid-based world, collect digital tokens, and merge them to craft higher-value items using geolocation or on-screen controls.

## How It Works

- The world is divided into a grid mapped to real-world coordinates
- Players move by walking in real life (geolocation) or using directional buttons
- Tokens can be collected and merged to create higher-value items
- Progress is saved automatically and persists between sessions

## Built With

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Browser Geolocation API
- LocalStorage

## Play the Game

### Notes

- Button-based movement is available if geolocation is unavailable
- Starting a new game is recommended when changing locations significantly
- Need to allow location services
