World of Bits

A real-world, map-based crafting game where you move around the Earth, collect digital “bits,” and combine them to make higher-value tokens. Move in real life → your character moves in the game.

How the Game Works

1. The World

The world is split into a giant grid.

Each cell might contain a token (value 1).

You can see tokens anywhere on the map by scrolling.

2. Movement

You can control your player in two ways:

Geolocation mode: move in real life and your character moves.

Buttons mode: tap N / S / E / W to move one cell at a time.

You can switch modes anytime with the on-screen button.

3. Collecting

If you stand within 3 cells of a token, you can click it.

If your hand is empty, you pick it up.

4. Crafting

If you place a token onto another token with the same value, they combine:

value + value → doubled value

Example:
1 + 1 → 2
2 + 2 → 4
4 + 4 → 8 ... etc

5. Goal

Craft a high-value token 16
When you reach it, you win.

Saving Your Progress

The game automatically saves everything to your browser.

Closing the page does not reset your progress.

When you reopen the game, your world loads exactly as you left it.
